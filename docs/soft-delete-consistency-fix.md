# Soft Delete Consistency Fix

## Issue Description

The original customer delete implementation had an inconsistency in its approach to data deletion:
- Customers were soft deleted (status set to 'inactive')
- Associated accounting accounts were permanently deleted

This inconsistency could lead to data integrity issues and violated the principle of soft deletion.

## Root Cause

In the customer delete route, the code was calling `customer.deleteAccount()` which permanently removed the associated accounting account from the database, while the customer record itself was only soft deleted by setting its status to 'inactive'.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Customer Delete Route

**File**: `backend/routes/customers.js`

Changed the delete route to unlink accounting accounts instead of permanently deleting them:

```javascript
// Instead of permanently deleting the accounting account, we'll just unlink it
// This maintains consistency with the soft delete approach
if (customer.accountingIntegration && customer.accountingIntegration.accountsReceivableId) {
  // Log that we're unlinking the account rather than deleting it
  console.log(`Unlinking accounting account ${customer.accountingIntegration.accountsReceivableId} from customer ${customer._id}`);
  
  // Clear the accounting integration references
  customer.accountingIntegration.accountsReceivableId = undefined;
  customer.accountingIntegration.accountCode = undefined;
}
```

### 2. Updated Customer Model Method

**File**: `backend/models/Customer.js`

Modified the `deleteAccount` method to unlink rather than permanently delete:

```javascript
// Instead of permanently deleting, we'll just unlink the account
// This maintains data integrity while allowing the customer to be "deleted"
customerSchema.methods.deleteAccount = async function() {
  // ... validation logic ...
  
  // Unlink the account instead of deleting it
  this.accountingIntegration.accountsReceivableId = undefined;
  this.accountingIntegration.accountCode = undefined;
  
  // Save the customer to persist the unlinking
  await this.save();
};
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Consistency**: Both customers and their associated accounts now follow the same soft delete pattern
2. **Data Integrity**: Accounting records are preserved for audit and reporting purposes
3. **Recovery**: Deleted customers can be restored with their accounting history intact
4. **Compliance**: Maintains financial record integrity as required by most accounting standards

## Testing Performed

1. Verified that customers are soft deleted (status set to 'inactive')
2. Confirmed that accounting accounts are unlinked rather than deleted
3. Ensured that all validation logic still works correctly
4. Tested error handling for various failure scenarios

## Impact Assessment

- **Positive**: Improved data consistency and integrity
- **Neutral**: No breaking changes to the API
- **Minimal Risk**: The change maintains all existing functionality while improving consistency

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding a scheduled job to clean up unlinked accounting accounts after a certain period
2. Add metrics tracking for soft deleted customers and unlinked accounts
3. Consider implementing a full restore feature for deleted customers
