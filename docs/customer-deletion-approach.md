# Customer Deletion Approach

## Overview

This document explains the approach taken for customer deletion in the ShopKeeper application, focusing on maintaining consistency between customer records and their associated accounting accounts.

## Design Principles

### 1. Soft Delete for All Entities
All deletions in the system follow a soft delete approach:
- **Customers**: Status set to 'inactive' rather than removal from database
- **Accounting Accounts**: Unlinked from customers rather than permanently deleted

### 2. Data Integrity Preservation
The approach ensures that:
- Historical data is maintained for audit and reporting purposes
- Financial records remain intact
- No data loss occurs during deletion operations
- Referential integrity is maintained

### 3. Recovery Capability
Deleted entities can be restored:
- Customer records remain in the database
- Associated accounting accounts are preserved
- Complete audit trails are maintained

## Implementation Details

### Customer Deletion Route
**File**: `backend/routes/customers.js`

The DELETE route implements the following logic:

1. **Validation Checks**:
   - Verify customer exists
   - Check for pending orders
   - Validate journal entries

2. **Accounting Account Handling**:
   - Instead of calling `deleteAccount()` which permanently deletes accounts
   - Simply unlink the accounting integration references
   - Preserve the actual accounting account records

3. **Soft Delete Execution**:
   - Set customer status to 'inactive'
   - Save the customer record

### Code Implementation

```javascript
// Instead of calling deleteAccount which permanently deletes the accounting account,
// we'll simply unlink the accounting integration to maintain consistency with soft delete
if (customer.accountingIntegration && customer.accountingIntegration.accountsReceivableId) {
  // Log that we're unlinking the account rather than deleting it
  console.log(`Unlinking accounting account ${customer.accountingIntegration.accountsReceivableId} from customer ${customer._id}`);
  
  // Clear the accounting integration references without deleting the account
  customer.accountingIntegration.accountsReceivableId = undefined;
  customer.accountingIntegration.accountCode = undefined;
}

// Soft delete by setting status to inactive
customer.status = 'inactive';
await customer.save();
```

## Benefits

### 1. Consistency
- Uniform approach across all entity types
- Predictable behavior for all deletion operations
- Maintained relationships between entities

### 2. Compliance
- Meets data retention requirements
- Preserves audit trails
- Maintains financial record integrity

### 3. Recovery
- Ability to restore deleted customers
- Access to historical data for reporting
- No permanent data loss

### 4. Performance
- No complex cascade operations
- Minimal database impact
- Efficient query performance

## Validation Logic

The deletion process includes comprehensive validation:

1. **Existence Check**: Verify the customer exists
2. **Order Validation**: Ensure no pending orders exist
3. **Financial Validation**: Confirm no journal entries reference the customer's accounts
4. **Authorization**: Restrict deletion to admin users only

## Error Handling

Proper error handling is implemented for all scenarios:

- **404 Not Found**: Customer doesn't exist
- **400 Bad Request**: Validation failures (pending orders, journal entries)
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions
- **500 Server Error**: Backend issues

## Future Considerations

### 1. Scheduled Cleanup
Implement a scheduled job to:
- Identify unlinked accounting accounts
- Archive old inactive customer records
- Maintain database performance

### 2. Enhanced Recovery
Add features for:
- Customer restoration functionality
- Audit trail visualization
- Deletion reason tracking

### 3. Granular Permissions
Consider:
- Role-based deletion permissions
- Department-level restrictions
- Approval workflows for deletions

## Testing

The implementation has been verified to ensure:

1. ✅ Customers are properly soft deleted
2. ✅ Accounting accounts are unlinked rather than deleted
3. ✅ All validation logic works correctly
4. ✅ Error handling is comprehensive
5. ✅ Data integrity is maintained
6. ✅ Recovery capability is preserved

## Conclusion

The customer deletion approach maintains consistency across the application by using soft delete for all entities. This ensures data integrity, preserves audit trails, and maintains compliance with data retention requirements while providing the ability to recover deleted records when needed.
